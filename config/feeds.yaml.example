# Firecrawl Configuration (optional)
# =============================================================================
# URL of your self-hosted Firecrawl instance.
# When set, articles without full content in the feed will be fetched via
# Firecrawl, which handles JavaScript rendering and returns clean markdown.
# If not set, trafilatura is used as a fallback for direct HTTP fetching.

# Request timeout in seconds for Firecrawl and direct HTTP fetches.
firecrawl_timeout: 30

# =============================================================================
# Culling
# =============================================================================
# Delete articles older than this many days on each sync run.
# Set to 0 (default) to disable culling.
# Note: only articles ingested after this setting was added carry a timestamp;
# run with --full once to stamp existing articles and make them eligible.

# =============================================================================
# Feed List
# =============================================================================
# Each feed requires a 'url'. The 'name' is used in Qdrant payloads.
#
# Per-feed options:
#   fetch_content: true   (default) Fetch full article if feed content is short
#   fetch_content: false  Use only whatever the feed provides; never fetch page
